# Introduction

## What is A10 Control?

A10 Control is a centralized management platform that enables monitoring, management, and optimization of A10 infrastructure from a single interface.

Think of it as a control room that gives visibility into your network services, device health, and performance.

## Why It’s Used

Without centralized visibility, administrators must manage devices individually.
A10 Control simplifies operations by:

- Providing real-time monitoring
- Centralizing configuration visibility
- Improving response time to issues
- Helping maintain service reliability
